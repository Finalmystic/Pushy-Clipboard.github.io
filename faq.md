### Chrome Extension

* **How do I uninstall this?**

  Right click on the icon in the browser toolbar and select
  **Remove From Chrome...**

* **I clicked on one of the email links in Help & Feedback, but nothing happened. Why is that?**

  You need to have an app defined that handles email links on your computer.
  This could either be an application you use that is separate from Chrome (e.g. Outlook)
  or a web based email app. To define your web based app (e.g. Google Mail)
  go to its web page. On the right side of the URL bar, next to the star
  there should be another icon. Click on it and allow it to be your email
  handler.
